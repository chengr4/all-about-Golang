## FAQ

### 1. Why a New Language?

At the moment just before `Golang` was created:

+ `Python`: Easy to use but slow (interpreted language)
+ `Java`: Increasingly complex type system
+ `C/C++`: Complex type system and Slow compile times (E.g. `C++` applications written 10 years age still need to compile today)
